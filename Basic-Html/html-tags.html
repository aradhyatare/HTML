            occur naturally within environments that exist relatively undisturbed 
            by mankind, in a natural form. A natural resource is often characterized 
            by amounts of biodiversity existent in various ecosystems. Natural 
            <br clear="all" />
            resources are derived from the environment. Many of
            them are essential for our survival while others are used for satisfying 
            our wants. Natural resources may be further classified in different ways.
